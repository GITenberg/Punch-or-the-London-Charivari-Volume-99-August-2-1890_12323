    <h2>ROBERT'S AMERICAN ACQUAINTANCE.</h2>

    <p>My akwaintance among eminent selebraties seems to be rapidly
    encreasing. Within what <i>Amlet</i> calls a week, a little
    week, after my larst intervue with the emenent young Swell as
    amost lost his art to the pretty Bridesmade, I have been onored
    with the most cordial notice of a werry emenent Amerrycane, who
    cums to Lundon wunce ewery year, and makes a good long stay,
    and allus cums to one or other of our Grand Otels. He says he's
    taken quite a fansy to me, and for this most singler reason. He
    says as I'm the ony Englishman as he has ewer known who can
    allus giv a answer rite off to ewery question as he arsks me!
    So much so, that he says as how as I ort to be apinted the
    Guide, Feelosofer, and Frend of ewery one of the many Wisiters
    as we allus has a staying here!</p>

    <p>Well, all I can say is, that if I affords the heminent
    Amerrycane jest about harf the fun and emusement as he does me,
    I must be a much cleverer feller than I ewer thort myself, or
    than my better harf ewer told me as I was. Ah, wouldn't he jest
    make her stare a bit if she herd sum of his most owdacious
    sayings. Why, he acshally says, that the hole system of
    marrying for life is all a mistake, and not consistent with our
    changable nature! And that we ort to take our Wives on lease,
    as we does our houses, wiz., for sewen or fourteen years, and
    that in a great majority of cases they woud both be preshus
    glad when the end of the lease came! And he tries werry hard to
    make me bleeve, tho in course he doesn't succeed, that in one
    part of his grate and staggering Country, ewerybody does jest
    as he likes in these rayther himportant matters, and has jest
    as many Wives as he can afford to keep, and that the King of
    that place has about a dozen of 'em! Ah, if you wants to hear a
    reel downright staggerer as nobody carnt posserbly bleeve,
    don't "ask the Pleaceman," but arsk an Amerrycane!</p>

    <p>He wanted werry much to go to Brighton, and see our new
    Grand Metropole Otel opened last Satterday; so I spoke to our
    most gentlemanly Manager, and he gave him a ticket that took
    him down first-class, and brort him back, and took him into the
    Otel, and supplied him with heverythink as art coud wish for,
    or supply, and as much Shampane as he could posserbly
    drink&mdash;and, when there ain't nothink to pay for it, it's
    reelly estonishing what a quantity a gennelman can dispose
    of&mdash;; and the way in which he afterwards told me as he
    showed his grattitude for what he called a reel first-class
    heavening's enjoyment was, to engage a delicious little sweet
    of apartments for a fortnite, so we shall see him no more for
    that length of time. He told me as he had seen all the great
    Otels of Urope and Amerrykey, but he was obligated to confess,
    in his own emphatic langwidge, that the Brighton Metropole
    "licked all creation!" I didn't quite understand him, but I've
    no doubt it was intended as rayther complimentary. He rayther
    staggered me by asking what it cost, but I was reddy with my
    anser, and boldly said, jest exacly a quarter of a million.</p>

    <p>He told me that, in his own grand country, he was ginerally
    regarded as a werry truthful man, which, of course, I was
    pleased to hear, for sum of his statements was that staggering
    as wood have made me dowt it in a feller-countryman. For
    hinstance, he acshally tried to make me bleeve that his Country
    is about 20 times as big as ours! Well, in course, common
    politeness made me pretend to bleeve him, speshally as he's
    remarkable liberal to me, as most of his countrymen is, but I
    coudn't help thinking as it woud have been wiser of him if he
    had made his werry long Bow jest a leetle shorter. He's a
    remarkabel fine-looking gennelman, and his manners quite comes
    up to my description. ROBERT.</p>

    <p>The Austrian Inventor, who has just designed his ship of a
    mile in length that is to travel through the water at
    eighty-seven miles an hour, and cross the Atlantic in something
    under a day and a half, is, I am told, only waiting the
    requisite capital to enable him at once to set about carrying
    his project into effect. Each vessel will be provided with an
    Opera House a Cathedral, including a Bishop, who will be one of
    the ship's salaried officers; a Circus, Cricket-ground,
    Cemetery, Race-course, Gambling-saloon, and a couple of lines
    of Electric Tram-cars. The total charge for board and transit
    will be only 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, which will bring the
    fare to New York to something like 16<i>s.</i> As it is
    calculated that at least 100,000 passengers will cross the
    Atlantic on each journey, the financial aspect of the whole
    concern seems sound. As I said before, the only difficulty is
    the capital. Surely some enterprising Croesus who has thirty

    <h2>COMING SEA-SCRAPES AT CHELSEA.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Drawn by an Insider.</i>)</h4>

    <p>MR. PUNCH, SIR,</p>

    <p>That the sister Service should also have its turn at Chelsea
    I reckon I can understand, and the Show ought to be popular;
    but if the Admiralty want to make a further "exhibition" of
    themselves, they won't have to go very far a-field for
    material. Here are one or two exhibits that come to hand at
    once. First, there's those big guns which it ain't safe to fire
    nohow, and which, if you do load with half a charge, crack,
    bend, and get sent back to be "ringed" up, whatever that means,
    and are not safe, even for a salute, ever afterwards. Then, in
    another case, they might show a foot or two of that blessed
    boiler-piping which is always leaking, or splitting, or
    bursting, just when it shouldn't. In a third they might display
    a chop that had been cooked from lying exposed in one of those
    famous stokeholes where the poor beggars of sailors are
    expected to pass their time without getting roasted too. Then
    there might be, as a sort of prize puzzle, a plan of these here
    recent manoeuvres, with the Umpire's opinion of the whole
    blessed jumble tacked on to it. Then, to enliven the
    proceedings. Lord GEORGE might take his turn with the rest of
    the Admiralty Board, and give us, every half hour or so, a
    figure or two of the Hornpipe, just to let the public see that
    they have got some sort of nautical "go" about them to warrant
    them in drawing their big screw. Bless you, <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
    there's lots to make an Exhibition of at Chelsea next year if
    you come to calculate. Leastways that's the opinion of your
    humble servant and admirer,</p>

    cigarette between his lips. He had been knocking about
    Piccadilly all day, had dined at the Junior, looked in at the

    <p>There he stood in his neat, serviceable undress uniform,
    with a cigar between his lips. He had abandoned the swagger
    frogged coat and silk sash for the unpretending patrol jacket
    of his brethren in the Line. He had been hard at work all day
    in barracks, inspecting meals, visiting the hospital, attending
    parades. He had paid his company personally, had seen every
    man, and found that there were no complaints. He had attended a
    mess meeting, and had dined at mess, playing a rubber
    afterwards (sixpenny points) in the ante-room. He knew as much
    about the internal economy of the Battalion as the Colonel, the
    Adjutant, or the Sergeant-Major. He seemed a soldier of
    soldiers. The most casual observer would have declared that he
    was acquainted with every inch of the barrack-yard. So general
    surprise was expressed when the question was asked him.</p>

    <p>"What am I?" he repeated, briskly; and then he replied, with
    a smile, "Can't you see, stupid? Why, an Officer in the

    <p><i>Phil</i>. Come along then, and I'll introduce you. If she
    asks you to her parties by any chance, mind you go&mdash;sure
    to meet a lot of interesting people.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> (<i>pulling up his collar</i>). Just what I
    enjoy&mdash;meeting interesting people&mdash;the only society
    worth cultivating, to my mind, Sir. Give me
    <i>intellect</i>&mdash;it's of more value than wealth!</p>

    expression he has, to be sure&mdash;really quite apostolic!</p>

    <p><i>Second Lady</i>. We are not in his parish, but I have
    always heard him spoken of as a most excellent man.</p>

    <p><i>First Lady</i>. Excellent! My dear, that man is a perfect
    <i>Saint</i>! I don't believe he knows what it is to have a
    single worldly thought! And such trials as he has to bear, too!
    With that <i>dreadful</i> wife of his!</p>

    <p><i>Second Lady</i>. That's the wife, isn't it?&mdash;the
    dowdy little woman, all alone, over there? Dear me, what
    <i>could</i> he have married her for?</p>

    <p><i>First Lady</i>. Oh, for her <i>money</i>, of course, my
    dear!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Pattallons</i> (<i>to Mrs. ST. MARTIN

    didn't know you at first. I was just thinking, "Now who
    <i>is</i> that young and lovely person coming along the path?"
    You see&mdash;I came out without my glasses to-day, which
    accounts for it!</p>

    Hullo, TOTO, how are <i>you</i>, eh, young lady?</p>

    <p><i>Toto</i> (<i>primly</i>). I'm very well indeed, thank
    you. (<i>With sudden interest</i>). How's the idiot? Have you
    seen him lately?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. C.</i> (<i>mystified</i>). The idiot, eh? Why, fact
    is, I don't <i>know</i> any idiot!&mdash;give you my word!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Prattleton</i>. Let me see&mdash;<i>did</i> we have
    a fine Summer in '87? Yes, of course&mdash;I always remember
    the weather by the clothes we wore, and that June and July we
    wore scarcely anything&mdash;some filmy stuff that belonged to
    one's ancestress, don't you know. <i>Such</i> fun! By the way,

    <p><i>Mrs. Hussiffe</i> (<i>to Mr. DE MURE</i>). Perhaps

        <p>Mr. TABLETT <i>has been introduced to</i> Mrs. MAYNARD

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> (<i>enthusiastically</i>). I'm so delighted
    to make your acquaintance. When my brother-in-law told me who
    you were, I positively very nearly shrieked. I am such an
    admirer of your&mdash;(<i>thinks she won't commit herself to
    the whole title</i>&mdash;<i>and so compounds</i>)&mdash;your
    delightful <i>Sabrina</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Most gratified to hear it, I'm sure, I'm told
    there's a growing demand for it.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> Such a hopeful sign&mdash;when one was
    beginning quite to despair of the public taste!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Well, I've always said&mdash;So long as you
    give the Public a really first-rate article, and are prepared
    to spend any amount of money on <i>pushing</i> it, you know,
    you're sure to see a handsome return for your outlay&mdash;in
    the long run. And you see, I've had this carefully analysed, by
    competent judges&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> Ah, but <i>you</i> can feel independent of
    criticism, can't you?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Oh, I defy anyone to find anything unwholesome
    in it&mdash;it's as suitable for the most delicate child as it
    is for adults&mdash;nothing to irritate the most
    sensitive&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> Ah, you mean certain critics are so
    thin-skinned&mdash;they are indeed!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> (<i>warming to his subject</i>). But the
    beauty of this particular composition is that it causes
    absolutely <i>no</i> unpleasantness or inconvenience
    afterwards. In some cases, indeed, it acts like a charm. I've
    known of two cases of long-standing erysipelas it has
    completely cured.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> (<i>rather at sea</i>). How gratifying that
    must be. But that is the magic of all truly great work, it is
    such an <i>anodyne</i>&mdash;it takes people so completely out
    of themselves&mdash;doesn't it?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> It takes anything of that sort out of
    <i>them</i>, Ma'am. It's the finest discovery of the age, no
    household will be without it in a few months&mdash;though
    perhaps I say it who shouldn't.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> (<i>still more astonished</i>). Oh, but I
    <i>like</i> to hear you. I'm so tired of hearing people
    pretending to disparage what they have done, it's such a
    <i>pose</i>, and I hate posing. Real genius is <i>never</i>
    modest. (<i>If he had been more retiring, she would have, of
    course, reversed this axiom</i>.) I <i>wish</i> you would come
    and see me on one of my Tuesdays, Mr. TABLETT, I should feel so
    honoured, and I think you would meet some congenial
    spirits&mdash;do look in some evening&mdash;I will send you a
    card if I may&mdash;let me see&mdash;could you come and lunch
    next Sunday? I've got a little man coming who was very nearly
    eaten up by cannibals. I think <i>he</i> would interest
    you.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> I shall be proud to meet him. Er&mdash;did
    they eat <i>much</i> of him?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> (<i>who privately thinks this rather
    vulgar</i>). How <i>witty</i> you are! That's quite worthy of
    a&mdash;<i>Sabrina</i>, really! Then you <i>will</i> come? So
    glad. And now I mustn't keep you from your other admirers any
    longer. [<i>She dismisses him</i>.</p>

    <h4>LATER.</h4>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> (<i>to her Brother-in-law</i>). How
    <i>could</i> you say that dear Mr. TABLETT was <i>dull</i>,
    PHIL? I found him perfectly charming&mdash;so original and
    unconventional! He's promised to come to me. By the way,
    <i>what</i> did you say the name of his book was?</p>

    <p><i>Phil</i>. I never said he had written a book.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> PHIL&mdash;you
    <i>did</i>!&mdash;<i>Sabrina's Other&mdash;Something</i>. Why,
    I've been <i>praising</i> it to him, entirely on your
    recommendation.</p>

    <p><i>Phil</i>. No, no&mdash;<i>your</i> mistake. I only asked
    you if you'd read <i>Sabrina's Uncle's Other Niece</i>, and, as
    I made up the title on the spur of the moment, I should have
    been rather surprised if you had. <i>He</i> never wrote a line
    in his life.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> How <i>abominable</i> of you! But surely
    he's famous for <i>something</i>? He talks like it. [<i>With
    reviving hope</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Phil</i>. Oh, yes, he's the inventor and patentee of the
    new "Sabrina" Soap&mdash;he says he'll make a fortune over
    it.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.G.</i> But he hasn't even done <i>that</i> yet!
    PHIL, I'll <i>never</i> forgive you for letting me make such an
    idiot of myself. What <i>am</i> I to do now? I <i>can't</i>
    have him coming to me&mdash;he's really too impossible!</p>

    <p><i>Phil</i>. Do? Oh, order some of the soap, and wash your
    hands of him, I suppose&mdash;not that he isn't a good deal
    more presentable than some of your lions, after all's said and
    done!</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;<i>Hamlet</i>. Music by AMBROISE
    THOMAS, and <i>libretto</i> by Messieurs CARR&Eacute; and
    BARBIER, who seem to have read <i>Hamlet</i> once through,
    after which they wrote down as a <i>libretto</i> what they
    remembered, of the story. It would be difficult to mention any
    Opera less dramatic than this. The question arises at once,
    adapting the immortal phrase of JAMES LE SIFFLEUR, "Why lug in
    <i>Hamlet</i>?" Why not have called it <i>Ophelia</i>? Whatever
    interest there may be in the Opera&mdash;and there is very
    little&mdash;is centred entirely in <i>Ophelia</i>. The
    <i>Ghost</i> is utterly purposeless, but of distinguished
    appearance as a robust spectre, marching in at one gate, and
    out at another, or hiding behind a sofa, and popping up
    suddenly, in order to frighten an equally purposeless
    <i>Hamlet.</i> Like father, like son. M. LASSALLE is a fine,
    substantial, baritonial <i>Hamlet</i>, who is always posturing,
    weeping, calling out <i>ma m&egrave;re</i>, and blubbering on
    the ample matronly bosom of his mother, Madame RICHARD ("O
    RICHARD! <i>O ma Reine</i>!") like a big, blubbering, overgrown
    schoolboy. Were I inclined to disquisitionise, I should say
    that Messieurs CARR&Eacute; and BARBIER have actually realised
    SHAKSPEARE's own description of his jelly-fleshed hero, whose
    mind is as shaky as his well-covered body. <i>Hamlet</i>
    was&mdash;as SHAKSPEARE took care to emphasise&mdash;"fat, and
    scant of breath"&mdash;which was the physical description of
    the actor who first impersonated the leading <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
    of this play; and the French author's idea of <i>Hamlet</i>
    was, accordingly, a fat youth, very much out of condition, home
    from Wittenberg College, in consequence of his father's recent
    decease.</p>

             alt="" /></a>Hamlet is out of it in the last Act. Why
             wasn't he brought into the Ballet?
    </div>

    <p>Some of the lighter musical portions of the Opera are
    charming, and the Chorus at the end of Act I, might have been
    written by OFFENBACH. But what is there of the story? Nothing.
    The King is not killed: the Queen isn't poisoned:
    <i>Polonius</i> is not stabbed behind the arras, having been,
    perhaps, killed before the Opera commenced, since his name
    appears in the book but not in the programme, and the only
    person on the stage that I could possibly associate with that
    dear old Lord Chamberlain was M. MIRANDA, who had donned a
    white beard and a different robe from what he had been
    previously wearing as <i>Horatio</i> in the First and Second
    Acts, in order to enter and lead the King away, in an
    interpolated and ineffective scene which was not in the book. A
    very hard-working Opera for the principals, and a thankless
    task. <i>Hamlet's</i> drinking song fine, and finely sung. But
    the whole point of the Opera is in the last Act, where there is
    a <i>ballet</i> that has nothing to do with the piece, but
    pretty to see little PALLADINO in short white skirts, dancing
    merrily in a forest glade, among the happy peasantry, to whom
    comes <i>Ophelia</i>, mad as several hatters, and after a
    lunatic scene, charming, both musically and dramatically,
    throws herself into the water, and dies singing.</p>

    <p>Here is a suggestion for the effective compression and
    reduction of the Opera, and if my plan be accepted, DRURIOLANUS
    will earn the eternal gratitude of those who would like to hear
    all that is good in it, and to skip, as PALLADINO does, the
    rest. Thus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>ACT I.&mdash;<i>Enter</i> HAMLET. <i>Solo. Exit. Enter</i>
    OPHELIA. <i>Solo. Re-enter</i> HAMLET. OPHELIA <i>and</i>
    HAMLET <i>love-duet. Exit</i> OPHELIA. HAMLET'S <i>Friends come
    in, and he sings them a Drinking Song with Chorus. All join in
    Chorus and Dance. Curtain</i>.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:45%;">
        <a href="images/53-3.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/53-3.png"
             alt="" /></a>An awkward moment for Hamlet. Row with
             his Mother and Ophelia.
    </div>

    <p>ACT II.&mdash;<i>Opening Chorus (anything; it doesn't matter
    if it's only pretty and bright). Enter</i> HAMLET. <i>Solo</i>.
    "<i>&Ecirc;tre, ou ne pas &ecirc;tre." Enter</i> OPHELIA
    <i>with book, pretends not to see</i> HAMLET. <i>Solo.
    Enter</i> Queen. OPHELIA <i>complains to her that</i> HAMLET
    <i>isn't behaving like a gentleman.</i> Queen <i>upbraids</i>
    HAMLET: <i>So does</i> OPHELIA: HAMLET <i>depressed, Exit</i>
    Queen R.H. <i>Exit</i> OPHELIA L.H. HAMLET <i>remains,
    evidently going mad</i>. PALLADINO <i>looks in. Dances</i>.
    HAMLET <i>joins her. Enter Friends, Courtiers, Peasants, and
    other Friends. All join in ballet</i>, HAMLET <i>included.
    Enter</i> Keepers, <i>and</i> HAMLET <i>is taken off to
    Hanwellhagen</i>. OPHELIA <i>rushes in, faints.
    Curtain</i>.</p>

    <p>ACT III.&mdash;<i>Meadows near Hanwellhagen, in Denmark.
    Dance of Lunatics, out for a holiday. To them enter</i>
    OPHELIA. <i>All the charming music, delightful, and, this being
    finished, she chucks herself away into the stream.
    Curtain</i>.</p>

    <p>Great call for everybody concerned. And, if the above scheme
    be adopted, the Opera would be over before eleven, having begun
    at nine. I present this with my compliments to DRURIOLANUS and
    AMBROISE THOMAS; and, if he is not "a doubting THOMAS," he will
    try this plan.</p>

    <p>The remainder of the week passed away happily, so I hear,
    but was not able to be in my place, as I was at somebody else's
    place far, far away. The Opera has been, from the first, a big
    success. Should like to hear <i>Masaniello</i> once again.
    Perhaps that is a treat in store for all of us. Thus ends the
    Opera-goer's Diary for 1890, and everybody is highly satisfied
    and delighted. Curtain.</p>

    <h2>IN THE KNOW.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Am I going to Goodwood? I answer that question by another.
    Is it likely that a race-meeting of any pretensions can
    possibly do without one whom even his enemies acknowledge to be
    the only accurate and high-minded sporting writer in the world?
    Those who care (and I devoutly hope that Mr. J., whose brains
    equal those of a newly-born tadpole, will not be amongst the
    number) can see me at any moment on pronouncing the password,
    "mealy-mouth," in my old place, <i>close to the space devoted
    to Royalty.</i> Yes, I shall be there. In the meantime, I
    propose to treat of the horses as only I can treat of them. I
    have nothing to say against <i>Pioneer</i>, except that the
    name promises very well for one who means to lead the way.
    <i>Nous verrons</i>, as RACINE said, on a celebrated occasion.
    As for <i>The Imp</i>, I cannot too strongly lay it down that
    only blue devils are bad for the digestion, and <i>Galloping
    Queen</i> may gallop farther than or not so far as <i>Miss
    Ethel</i>. A miss must be better than a mile to win. If
    <i>Theophilus</i> were <i>Formidable</i>, or if <i>Imogene</i>
    possessed a <i>Grecian Bend</i>, it might be necessary to sound
    <i>Reveille</i> in <i>Rotten Row</i>, which would certainly be
    a <i>Marvel</i>. Not being a roadster, I sometimes like <i>The
    Field</i>.</p>

    <p>The above information ought to be sufficient to guide
    anybody whose brains are calculated to fill an egg-cup. All
    others may go to Earlswood, where they will probably meet Mr.
    J.</p>

    <h3><i>An Anglo-Indian Gentleman introduced.</i></h3>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/57-1.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p><i>The Commissioner</i>. Well, Sir, What can I do for
    you?</p>

    <p><i>Anglo-Indian</i>. I wish respectfully to call your
    attention, Sir, to our case, which is now before a
    Parliamentary Committee. I am an Indian Civil Servant. I am
    called a member of the Uncovenanted Service, but I contend that
    such a term is a misnomer. Originally the Uncovenanted Service
    consisted of Natives of India, who were employed, without
    covenant, to do subordinate official work, under the direction
    of the Covenanted Civil Service. The bulk of these persons were
    overseers and tax-collectors.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Has there been any alteration of late years?
    I see you lay a stress upon <i>originally</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Anglo-In.</i> At this moment there are in the Service, in
    one department alone&mdash;the Educational&mdash;a Senior
    Classic, a Second Wrangler, several other Wranglers, and many
    Fellows of Oxford and Cambridge, who took high honours with
    their degrees. The Service now requires great technical
    knowledge, as it has to deal with Arch&aelig;ology, Finance,
    Geological Survey, Public Works, and Telegraphy, and can only
    be entered by Europeans, who have been selected by nomination,
    or after competition, either by the Secretary of State for
    India, or the Government of India. It is not an Uncovenanted
    Service, as we now enter it with the prospect of pension; and
    one of our grievances is, that that prospect has become less
    favourable through the recent action of our employers.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Be kind enough to explain.</p>

    <p><i>Anglo-In.</i> Certainly, Sir. When we entered the Service
    our pension, after serving thirty years, was stated by the
    Secretary of State to be &pound;500. Naturally this was taken
    to mean gold, but because years ago the Service consisted of
    Natives, the Government hit upon the plan of paying us in
    silver, which at the present rate means a loss of &pound;150 in
    the &pound;500.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Are the members of the other Indian
    Services, Civil and Military, treated in like manner?</p>

    <p><i>Anglo-In.</i> No, they are paid their pensions in
    gold.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Well, considering the class of men who now
    enter your Service I do not see why you should be put at so
    great a disadvantage. Have you any other grievances?</p>

    <p><i>Anglo-In.</i> Well, thirty years is a long time to have
    to serve in a climate as trying as the tropics, especially when
    we are not allowed to count furlough as service.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> I think so, too. Then I may sum up your
    grievances thus. You are educated men, and therefore deserve
    fair treatment. You would consider fair treatment, payment of
    pensions in gold, and the lessening of the years of service
    necessary to earn the right of retirement?</p>

    <p><i>Anglo-In.</i> Exactly, Sir; and I cannot thank you
    sufficiently for putting our case so plainly.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Not at all. Should you receive no redress
    within a reasonable time, you may mention the matter to me
    again.</p>

    <h2>THE SHADOW OF A CASE!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>To the Editor of Punch.</i>)</h4>

    <p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;As the leading forensic journal of this
    great country (your contemporary <i>Weekly Notes</i> runs you
    pretty close occasionally in some of its reports), I address
    you. It was my painful duty a few days ago (I had to "take a
    note" for a colleague, an occupation more honourable than
    lucrative), to be present at a cause that was heard before the
    President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of
    the High Court of Justice and a Special Jury. The trial created
    considerable interest, not only amongst the general public, but
    amongst that branch of our honourable Profession represented by
    the Junior Bar, no doubt, because certain points of law, not
    easily recognisable&mdash;I frankly confess, I myself, am
    unable to recount them&mdash;were no doubt in question, and had
    to be decided by competent authority. The Counsel directly
    engaged were some of the brightest ornaments of Silk and Stuff.
    Amongst the rest were my eloquent and learned friend, Sir
    CHARLES RUSSELL, my erudite and learned friend Mr. INDERWICK
    (whose <i>Side-lights upon the Stuarts</i>, is a marvel of
    antiquarian research), and my mirth-compelling and learned
    friend Mr. FRANK LOCKWOOD, whose law is only equalled (if,
    indeed, it is equalled) by his comic draughtmanship. As the
    details of the trial have been fully reported, there is no
    necessity to go into particulars. However, there was a feature
    in the case that the passing notice of an article in one or
    more of the leading journals is scarcely sufficient to
    meet.</p>

    <p>It was proved that the detective part of divorce (if I may
    use the expression) may be conducted in a fashion, to say the
    least, of not the most entirely satisfactory character. A
    talented family were called before us, whose performances were,
    from one point of view, extremely amusing. But, Sir, although
    (as you will be the first to admit) laughter is a most
    excellent thing in its proper place, the sound of cachinnation
    is seldom pleasing in the Divorce Court. Under these
    circumstances I would propose that, in future, Divorce
    Shadowing should be put under the protection of the State.
    There should be a special department, and the Shadowers should
    be of the distinguished position of Mr. MCDOUGALL of the London
    County Council, and the like. The office of the rank and file
    of the Shadowers should be honorary, as the pleasure of
    following in (possibly) unsavoury steps in the cause of virtue,
    would be to them, I presume, ample reward for any trouble the
    labour might entail. I would willingly myself undertake the
    responsibilities attaching to the post of Director-General, of
    course on the understanding that a suitable provision were
    made, not only as compensation for the loss of my practice, but
    also that I might perform the duties of the office with
    suitable dignity. But when I say this, I would add, that I
    should reserve to myself the right of seeking the supplementary
    services of the Archbishop of CANTERBURY, and Mr. Sheriff
    AUGUSTUS HARRIS, as assessors in assisting me to distinguish
    between innocence and vice, and guilt and virtue.</p>

    <p>Believe me, with an expression of all necessary respect for
    "the Nobility" connected with the case to which I have
    referred, and admiration for the courage of a certain
    Militiaman, exhibited by his entering the witness-box, and
    there facing the cross-examination he so richly deserved, I
    remain, Yours truly,</p>

    <p>(<i>Signed</i>) A BRIEFLESS, JUNIOR.</p>

    <p>Poet and Prophet are nearly allied. Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN is an
    illustration of this, in his recently published <i>English
    Lyrics</i> (MACMILLAN) all of which he must have written in
    utter ignorance of the doings of the Chairman of the County
    Council. Yet, hath the Prophetic Poet these lines:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Primrose, why do you pass away?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And the Primrose's return:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Nay, rather, why should we longer stay?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But the Conservative bias of the Poet is shown in the next
    line:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"<i>We</i> are not needed," &amp;c.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The commencement of the poem, however, as here quoted, is
    evidently an inspiration for which the Poet was not
    responsible. It is a charming little volume of charming verse.
    It is good poetic wine, which needs not the bush provided by
    Mr. WILLIAM WATSON in the shape of a thickset introduction.
    What, asks W.W., is the attitude of ALFRED AUSTIN towards
    Nature? This recalls a well-known scene in <i>Nicholas
    Nickleby</i>&mdash;"She's a rum 'un, is Natur'," said <i>Mr.
    Squeers</i>. "She is a holy thing, Sir," remarked <i>Mr.
    Snawley</i>. "Natur'," said <i>Mr. Squeers</i>, solemnly, "is
    more easier conceived than described. Oh, what a blessed thing,
    Sir, to be in a state of natur'!" And these observations of
    Messrs. <i>Snawley</i> and <i>Squeers</i> pretty accurately sum
    up all that the ingenious WILLIAM WATSON has to say about
    Natur' and ALFRED AUSTIN. The moral of which lies in the
    application of it, which is,&mdash;skip the preface, and make
    plunge into the poetry.</p>

    <p>A good deal has been written in olden time and of late about
    the Oberammergau Passion Play. Nothing has been better done
    than the work by Mr. EDWARD R. RUSSELL, formerly M.P. for
    Glasgae, who visited Oberammergau this year. His account is
    instinct with keen criticism, fine feeling, and reasoning
    reverence. Moreover, whilst other works are padded out into
    bulky volumes, he says all that need be said in fifteen pages
    of a pleasantly-printed booklet&mdash;price sixpence. It is a
    reprint from letters which the errant Editor contributed to his
    journal, the <i>Liverpool Daily Post</i>, at the sign of which
    copies may be had. THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS &amp; Co.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM</h4>

    <h3>THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July</i> 21.&mdash;RITCHIE got
    another Bill through; not a measure of high imperial policy;
    nothing to do either with Heligoland or Zanzibar; only proposes
    to improve in various ways the dwellings of the industrial
    classes. Still, as JOKIM has shown in connection with one or
    two of his little Bills, it is quite possible nearly to wreck a
    Ministry even on matter-of-fact business arrangements. But
    RITCHIE isn't JOKIM, and so his Bill passes to-night, taking
    two steps at a time, both sides uniting in congratulation and
    cheers. WALTER FOSTER, rising, salutes the Minister with a
    quite touching bless-you-my-child attitude. FOSTER rather hints
    that the Bill everyone is so pleased with, is really his. True,
    RITCHIE'S name is on back, and he took charge of it in its
    passage through Committee and House. But the real man was
    FOSTER; his Amendments had made the Bill; he had moulded it in
    Committee, and now here he was to give it his blessing. Rather
    delicate position; sort of cracking up himself, which FOSTER
    would not do for the world; blushed a little, as he praised the
    Bill; otherwise accomplished his task with ease and grace,
    whilst RITCHIE, listening, twitched his eyebrows, and thought
    unutterable things.</p>

    <p>"I wish," said OLD MORALITY, "we had an embarrassment of
    RITCHIES, or even two or three more like him."</p>

    <p>OLD MORALITY been rather worried to-night; a hail-storm of
    questions on all sorts of subjects; amongst others, TIM HEALY
    and WILFRID LAWSON badgering him about the Local Taxation Bill.
    When is it really intended to take it? LAWSON asks OLD MORALITY
    back at the table again for twentieth time; literally gasping
    for breath; looked round House with anguished expression; then
    happy thought strikes him; "Mr. SPEAKER, Sir," he says, "it is
    really impossible to do more than one thing at a time."</p>

    <p>The pathetic earnestness with which this axiom was advanced,
    the sudden swift spasm of conviction that had flashed it across
    his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> mind, his certainty of the
       soundness of the assertion (paradoxical though it might
       appear), and his hasty, anxious glance below the Gangway
       opposite, apprehensive that that quarter would peradventure
       furnish a person capable of controverting it, all filled the
       House with keen delight. Laughed for full sixty seconds by
       Westminster clock; OLD MORALITY standing at table looking
       round and wondering what on earth he'd said now.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Census Bills read Second
    Time.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Pretty quiet sitting, till DIMSDALE
    craftily crept upon the scene. Don't often hear from this
    distinguished member of the Order of Noble Barons; generally
    content to serve his country by voting for the Government.
    To-night stirred in sluggish depths by omission of Government
    in preparing Census Bill to provide for Religious Census; so
    the Noble Baron moves Amendment designed to authorise Religious
    Census. Opposition Benches nearly empty; those present listen
    listlessly; know it's all right; Government are pledged against
    Religious Census; no harm in the Noble Baron moving his
    Amendment and making his speech; the Bill as introduced is
    safe.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Then up gets RITCHIE; drops remark, in off-hand manner, as
    if it did not signify, that Members on Ministerial side are
    free to vote as they please. Sudden change of attitude in
    Opposition Benches. Listlessness vanishes; a whisper of
    treachery goes round; CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN makes hot protest;
    HARCOURT sent for; comes in gleefully; matters been going so
    quietly, place unbearable for him; now a row imminent, HARCOURT
    joyously returns to Front Bench. Seats fill up on both sides;
    OLD MORALITY hurries in; situation explained to him; dolefully
    shakes his head; HARCOURT thunders denunciation of a Ministry
    that plays fast and loose with House; then OLD MORALITY gets
    up, and publicly abjures DIMSDALE and his Amendment. It was, he
    explained, only RITCHIE'S fun in saying Ministerialists were
    free to vote as they pleased on this matter. The Government
    were against the Amendment, and of course good Ministerialists
    would vote with Ministers. So they did, and DIMSDALE'S rising
    hopes crushed by majority of 288 against 69.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;English Census Bill passed
    through Committee.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Came across NICHOLAS WOOD in remote
    corner of Corridor; had the depressed look familiar when he has
    been wrestling with great mental problems and finds himself
    worsted.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter now, NICHOLAS? Thinking over what OLD
    MORALITY said yesterday about impossibility of doing more than
    one thing at a time?"</p>

    <p>"No, TOBY," he said, wearily; "it's not that; gave that up
    at once. OLD MORALITY's a good fellow, but he's too subtle for
    me. It's this Police Question that bothers me; give up a good
    deal of time to mastering it. Sort of thing seemed likely to
    suit me; heard all MATTHEWS' speeches; tried to follow
    CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM; courted CONYBEARE'S company, and pursued
    PICKERSGILL with inquiries. Thought I'd got a pretty clear
    notion of what it all meant; and now it turns out all to have
    led up to making PULESTON Constable of Carnarvon. Never heard
    his name before in connection with the Police Question. He took
    no part in discussions; had nothing to do with it I ever heard
    of; just when I was comfortably getting on another tack, the
    whole question centres on PULESTON. It seems <i>he</i> was the
    Police Question, and now he's Constable of Carnarvon. Why
    Carnarvon? Why not stationed in the Lobby or the Central Hall
    where he would be with old friends? Suppose he'll wear a blue
    coat, bright buttons, and a belt, and will shadow LOYD-GEORGE
    who now sits for Carnarvon? If you write to him must you
    address your letters "P.C. PULESTON"? and shall we have to
    change refrain of our latest National Hymn? instead of singing
    '<i>Ask a Policeman?</i>' shall we have to chant 'Ask a
    PULESTON?' These are the new problems; suddenly rushed in,
    bothering me to death when I thought I'd got pretty well
    through Session, Recess close at hand and no more difficult
    points coming up. Don't think, TOBY, I was cut out for
    politics; perhaps I take them too seriously; but like to know
    things, and there are so many things to know."</p>

    <p>Try to cheer up NICHOLAS; suggest to him that he should put
    his questions down on the paper; might address them to
    FERGUSON; a little out of the way of Foreign Affairs; but a
    conversation publicly conducted between NICHOLAS and FERGUSON
    would be interesting.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Votes in Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;House in rather strange condition
    to-night; things all sevens and sixes; Motion is that
    Anglo-German Agreement Bill be read Second Time. Opinion very
    mixed on merits of measure; on the whole, no particular
    objection to it, even though with it goes Heligoland. Still, an
    Opposition must oppose; but where is the Opposition? Mr. G.
    came down last night; said he'd no particular objection to
    Treaty, but didn't like the process of confirming it; so
    publicly washed his hands of the business. Since the
    announcement appeared in papers, HERBERT tells me his
    illustrious father's life has been a burden to him. Every post
    brings him letters from rival advertising soap manufacturers,
    making overtures of business transactions.</p>

    <p>"Sir," runs one of these epistles, "alluding to your
    statement in the House of Commons last night that you publicly
    washed your hands of participation in the Anglo-German Treaty,
    would you have any objection to our stating that the substance
    used was our celebrated Salubrious Savon? Anticipating your
    favourable reply, we assume that you would have no objection to
    our publishing a portrait of you using our soap, with its
    familiar label, 'Does not wash collars.' We have only to add
    that in the event of your favourably accepting this suggestion,
    we shall esteem it a favour to be allowed to gratuitously
    supply you and your family with specimens of our art for the
    term of your natural lives."</p>

    <p>This is merely an incident in the struggle, illustrating one
    of the embarrassments it has evolved. Only man thoroughly happy
    is HARCOURT. He invented the line of attack on ground of breach
    of constitutional usages; put up Mr. G. to make his speech;
    supplied him with authorities, and in supplementary speech
    amazed House with his erudition. Made stupendous speech last
    night; literally gorged the House; to-night picks up fragments
    and provides another feast: six baskets wouldn't hold it.</p>

    <p>"Wish, TOBY, dear boy," he said, sinking back in his seat
    after delivering his second speech, cunningly grafted on an
    Amendment, "we could carry this over next week. I could easily
    make a speech a day. Remember when I was once in Ireland, asked
    a tenant how he liked the new agent, who was reputed to be very
    able business man. 'Well,' said my acquaintance, 'I don't know
    about his business daylings, but for blasphaymious language,
    he's <i>au revoir</i>.' On constitutional questions, TOBY, I
    may, with all modesty, say I'm <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
